# CI/CD pipeline contained in a YAML file which updates the code in the AWS ECR whenever a 
# push is made to the main branch from a local or remote source. This ensures continuous deployment
# of the scraping service, facilitating better maintanance. As the ECS task definition is set
# to pick up on the 'latest' tag when run, this style of deployment is sufficient for complete CI/CD.
